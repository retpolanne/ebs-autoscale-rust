# EBS Autoscaler Rust

This is a project inspired by the now deprecated [Amazon EBS Autoscale](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ebs-autoscale/tree/master). 

The purpose of this project is to reimplement the AWS EBS Autoscaler in a more robust language other than
bash, including better tests (unit testing, integration and self-tests).
